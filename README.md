# Student-Dropout-Risk-prediction

## Overview
A machine learning-based web system that predicts student dropout risk on the EduLearn platform. By analyzing academic performance, socio-economic background, and engagement metrics, the model provides real-time predictions and helps educators intervene early.

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- Flask (Web App Integration)
- HTML, CSS (Frontend)
- MySQL
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (Data Visualization)

## Machine Learning Models
- Logistic Regression  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- Random Forest

## Features
- Preprocessing of student data  
- Predictive modeling for dropout risk  
- Interactive dashboard with student ID input  
- ROC, Confusion Matrix, F1-score evaluation  
- Real-time dropout alerts for stakeholders

## Objective
To empower online learning platforms with intelligent dropout risk analysis and timely intervention mechanisms to improve student retention.
